# InfraMonitor

InfraMonitor is a Matlab-based tool for infrasound monitoring
that incorporates LANL-developed detection, association, and
location algorithms in addition to a Matlab implementation of the
Tau-P raytracing technique (Garces et al., 1998, Drob et al.,
2010).


InfraMonitor is based on three main algorithms - AFD, IA, and
BISL - summarized below. References for each algorithm are
provided in each section.

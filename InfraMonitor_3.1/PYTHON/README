PYTHON UTILITIES FOR INFRAMONITOR
---------------------------------

These Python scripts are provided AS EXAMPLES for running InfraMonitor in batch mode and
for analyzing the results. These scripts are not meant to run out-of-the-box but are for
help in designing your own scripts

For help on any of these files type: Python-Script -h
e.g. MakeWfdisc.py -h
Of course, you should ensure that this PYTHON directory has been added to your path

Scripts for pre-processing:
MakeWfdisc.py 		  - Make a wfdisc file from a bunch of SAC files (requires pysacio)
MakeSite.py   		  - Make a site file from a wfdisc file and SAC files (requires pysacio)
RobustSiteReader.py   - Formats a wfdisc file with nnsa format (which InfraMonitor can read)
RobustWfdiscReader.py - Formats a site file with nnsa format (which InfraMonitor can read)

Scripts for running InfraMonitor:
RunInfraMonitor.py    - Runs InfraMonitor in batch mode

Scripts for post-processing:
CleanEvents.py		  - Removes events from IMassoc, IMpoly, origin tables with duplicate arrivals
CatTables.py		  - Concatenates a bunch of separate IMassoc, IMpoly, origin tables
RemoveEvents.py		  - Removes events from IMassoc, IMpoly, origin tables based on the area of uncertainty
MakePolygonKML.py	  - Makes a Google Earth kml file for a given IMpoly table

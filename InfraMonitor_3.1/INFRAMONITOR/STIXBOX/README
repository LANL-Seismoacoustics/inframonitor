This is Stixbox 1.29. 
All programs are released under GNU General Public License.

The only documentation there is is the Contents-file and the
help texts for the functions in the m-files themselves.

For a guided tour try STIXDEMO. This unfortunately does not
work under Octave since it uses Matlab graphics heavily. 

=== Version 1.29 Changes from previous version =================

- The algorithm in RGAMMA is replaced by a fast rejection method.

=== Version 1.28 Changes from previous version =================

- Added the function CAT2TBL.
- Updated minor things in helptexts.

=== Version 1.27 Changes from previous version =================

- Fourth argument to LSFIT semantic extension to -1
- Bug in RCHI2 corrected

=== Version 1.26 Changes from previous version =================

- Bug in PBETA corrected so that it gives a result also for 
  pbeta(0,f1,f2).

=== Version 1.25 Changes from previous version =================

- New functions DGUMBEL, PGUMBEL, QGUMBEL, RGUMBEL, QQGUMBEL

=== Version 1.24 Changes from previous version =================

- CONTINCY contingency table analysis added.

- QQNORM updated to work with many plot symbols.

=== Version 1.23 Changes from previous version =================

- Fixed return values for LINREG

- CIBOOT updated to handle matrix valued function also for 
  method == 6.

- QUANTILE updated to accept also vector x and matrix p. And
  a small fix made in method 3 so that it accepts input p=1. 

- A new function PLOTEMPD plots empirical distribution.

- More added functions: RANKTRF, COVAR, CORR, SPEARMAN, KAPLAMAI,
  STDIZE.

=== Version 1.22 Changes from previous version =================

- Fixed identify to work correctly with string arrays.
- Added IDENTIF5 to work with cell array input in Matlab 5.

=== Version 1.2 Changes from previous version =================

- A bug in pbinom gave the wrong answer for k = n-1. This is 
  now corrected.

- The function PAIRS now plots fast by avoiding slow handle 
  graphics. 

- There is a new function for estimating univariate mixtures
  of normal distributions. 

- Functions are added for Weibull and lognormal distribution.

- Functions are added for Weibull and gamma paper plotting.


=== Version 1.1 Changes from previous version =================

- Upgraded to Matlab 5.2. It still runs under Matlab 4.x.

- Some things are fixed so that it runs better under Octave.

- LINREG updated so that it is more similar to LSFIT and not
  relying on Mathwork's polyfit. 

- QQPLOT can now handle datasets of different lengths.

- TEST2R was updated to handle ties correctly, and a serious bug
  was removed (datavalues 0 was erroneously removed earlier).

=== Version 1.03. Changes from previous version =================

- Regression intercept added as _last_ column instead, this
  is more intuitive when looking at the parameter vector. Also,
  polyfit does it that way.

- Linreg is for polynomial regression also.

- A nonparametric quantile confidence interval is included,
  as well as the elementary binomial distribution functions.

- The TEST1C is renamed to TEST1B and the previous stupid documentation
  changed.
